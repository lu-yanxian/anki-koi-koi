## What This Add-on Does

Hanafuda Koi-Koi is a traditional Japanese card game played with a 48-card flower-themed deck. This add-on turns it into a vocabulary learning tool.

Every time you attempt to capture a pair of cards during the game, a multiple-choice vocabulary question appears drawn from your selected Anki deck. Answer correctly and you capture the cards. Answer incorrectly and the penalty depends on your chosen mode.

Answers are recorded back into Anki's spaced repetition scheduler — correct answers advance the card's interval, wrong answers send it back for review — so playing the game counts as a genuine Anki review session.

The game is fully playable without a deck selected (it will skip vocab questions), so you can also use it as a standalone Koi-Koi game.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

As of this file being written, the add-on has not been uploaded to AnkiWeb. However, it will be uploaded soon once permitted by the site. Until then, manual installation is necessary.



1. Download `anki_koi_koi.ankiaddon` from the [GitHub repo page](https://github.com/zj-rubin/anki-koi-koi)
2. Open Anki
3. Go to **Tools → Add-ons → Install from file**
4. Select the downloaded `.ankiaddon` file
5. Restart Anki

Alternatively, unzip the file and copy the `hanafuda\_game` folder directly into your Anki `addons21` directory:

* **Windows:** `C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\addons21\\`
* **Mac:** `\~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/`
* **Linux:** `\~/.local/share/Anki2/addons21/`

### Requirements

* Anki 23.10 or later
* Desktop platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux) — not compatible with AnkiDroid or AnkiMobile

\---

## Getting Started

1. Launch Anki and go to **Tools → 🌸 Hanafuda Koi-Koi**
2. The game window opens. At the top, select a deck from the dropdown — this is the deck vocab questions will be drawn from
3. Click **New Game**
4. The dealer flip screen appears. Set your game options (see below), then click **Flip Cards** to determine who goes first
5. Play begins — click a card from your hand, then click a matching card on the field to attempt a capture

The indicator in the top-right corner of the log bar shows the connection status:

* **⬤ Anki connected** — flashcard questions are active
* **⬤ connecting...** — still establishing the bridge, wait a moment
* **⬤ no bridge (browser)** — running in browser preview mode, no Anki connection

\---

## The Game Window

The window is divided into several areas:

**Score boxes** — show each player's current score, name, and an indicator when it is their turn (highlighted border).

**CPU hand** — the CPU's face-down cards.

**Field** — the 8 cards in the centre of the table available for capture. Cards that match a card in your hand glow to indicate a valid play.

**Your hand** — your 8 cards. Click one to select it, then click a matching field card to attempt a capture.

**Deck** — the remaining draw pile shown as a face-down stack with the card count.

**Log bar** — shows the current game state, last action, and connection status.

**Yaku section** — at the bottom of the page, shows all possible yaku (scoring combinations) with those you have currently earned highlighted. A count badge shows how many of each card type you have captured.

\---

## Game Options (Pre-Round Settings)

These appear on the dealer flip screen before each game starts. Most are locked once the round begins.

### CPU Difficulty

Determines how the CPU plays. Locked at round start.

* **Easy** — plays randomly, never calls Koi-Koi. Good for learning the rules.
* **Normal** — greedy play (prefers higher-value cards), calls Koi-Koi when it has 7+ points or when you have called Koi-Koi first. The default.
* **Hard** — evaluates each possible play by its contribution to yaku progress, calls Koi-Koi aggressively, and will sometimes deliberately discard cards that would help you form a yaku (denial strategy).

### Game Mode

Determines the scoring structure. Locked at round start.

* **Count Down** — both players start with 30 points. When a round is won, the winner takes points from the loser (zero-sum). The game ends when a player reaches 0, or after 12 rounds. This is the traditional competitive scoring format.
* **Count Up** — both players start at 0 and accumulate points independently over 12 rounds. Points are never stolen. Whoever has more points at the end wins. This format is better for casual play.

### Wrong Answer Mode

Determines what happens when you answer a vocab question incorrectly. Locked at round start.

* **Learning** — no penalty. You always capture the cards regardless of your answer. The question is shown for learning purposes, and a wrong answer is still recorded to Anki (ease 1 = Again) so the card comes back for review, but the game is not affected.
* **Full Penalty** — a wrong answer shows the correct answer for a moment, then your hand card goes to the field. You do not capture. default selection.
* **Retry (3 strikes)** — a wrong answer fetches a new question. You have three attempts total. Three wrong answers in a row sends both cards to the field.
* **Duel Mode** — a wrong answer triggers a mini-duel. Both players draw a card from the deck face-up. The lower month wins. Win the duel and you still capture; lose and your hand card goes to the field.

### Questions per Card

How many vocab questions you must answer correctly to earn each capture. Set to 1 by default. Higher values give more practice per capture but slows the game. Can also be adjusted via the slider in the header during play.

### Hints

Choose your hint system for the game. Locked at round start.

* **3 per game** — you get 3 hints for the entire game. Using a hint reveals the correct answer highlighted in gold. Using a hint records the answer as ease 2 (Hard) to Anki.
* **Unlimited** — hints are always available, one per question.
* Both options are off by default (no hints).

### Hide Choices

When enabled, the multiple-choice options are hidden when a question first appears. A "Show Choices" button lets you reveal them when you are ready. This prevents you from associating each question with the position of its answer rather than the actual meaning. Can be toggled freely during the game via the header.

\---

## Header Controls

The header bar is always visible at the top of the screen.

### CPU Speed slider

Controls how long the CPU pauses between actions, from 0.4 seconds to 3.0 seconds. Default is 1.0 second. Increase this if you want more time to read the log between CPU moves.

### Q/card slider

Adjusts how many questions you must answer per capture, from 1 to 3. Can be changed at any time during the game.

### Hide Choices toggle

Toggles the hide-choices setting on or off during play. Synced with the toggle in the pre-game settings screen.

### History button

Opens the Round History panel (see below).

### Config button

Opens the Config panel (see below).

### Appearance button

Opens the Appearance panel (see below).

\---

## Config Panel

The Config panel lets you fine-tune how vocab questions are drawn from your deck. Open it at any time by clicking **Config** in the header.

### Field Detection

When you select a deck, the add-on automatically detects which fields to use as the question and answer. It uses the field names — for example, a field called "Hanzi" is recognized as a question field, and a field called "English" or "Definition" is recognized as an answer field.

The **Question Field** and **Answer Field** dropdowns show the auto-detected choice and let you override it manually. The "Auto would pick" label shows what the auto-detection selected for reference.

When you switch decks, field config automatically resets to auto-detect for the new deck.

### Card Pool \& Pacing

**Active pool** — how many cards from your deck are in your active study pool at once. Default is 20. The game works through these cards before pulling in new ones. Smaller pools mean more repetition and faster mastery of a small set; larger pools give more variety.

For example, with a pool of 10 and a 100-word deck: you will see words 1–10 repeatedly until you have answered all of them correctly, then the pool automatically advances to words 11–20, and so on. Once you reach the end of the deck, it resets and shuffles from the beginning.

**Focus slider** — adjusts the balance between new and reviewed cards within the active pool:

* **New** — prioritizes cards you have not yet seen in this session
* **Balanced** — mixes unseen and seen cards (default)
* **Review** — prioritizes cards you have already seen to reinforce them

### Ease Rating Buttons

When enabled, **Easy** and **Hard** buttons appear below the multiple-choice options during each question. These are for honest self-assessment — since multiple choice lets you guess, these buttons let you rate how well you actually knew the answer.

Easy lengthens the card's review interval; Hard shortens it. Easy also skips the card for the rest of the session.

\---

## Appearance Panel

Six visual themes are available, each named after a Japanese city:

* **Tokyo** — the default. Dark blue, professional and easy on the eyes.
* **Nara** — warm amber and chestnut, inspired by Nara's cedar forests and deer parks.
* **Hirosaki** — soft pinks and warm whites, inspired by Hirosaki Castle's famous cherry blossoms.
* **Kyoto** — imperial green, gold lacquer, and vermillion — the colors of Heian court culture.
* **Fukuoka** — deep navy, dark teal, and lavender, inspired by Fukuoka's coastal harbor.
* **Sapporo** — near-black background with cream surfaces and icy blue accents, evoking a Hokkaido winter night.

Click any theme to switch instantly. The selection is not saved between sessions — you will need to reselect your preferred theme each time you open the game.

\---

## Yaku Guide Panel

Click **Yaku Guide** next to the yaku section at the bottom of the screen to open a detailed reference panel listing all 13 yaku with:

* Japanese name and romanisation
* Point value
* Description of what the combination requires
* Which specific cards are involved

This is useful when you are learning which cards to prioritise capturing.

\---

## Round History Panel

Click **History** in the header to open a panel showing all completed rounds in the current game, newest first. Each entry shows:

* Round number
* Winner
* Yaku formed
* Points earned (with any multipliers noted)
* Running scores after that round

\---

## Vocabulary Challenge

When you attempt to capture a card pair, a challenge overlay appears with:

* The question (drawn from your selected deck's question field)
* Four multiple-choice answers (one correct, three drawn from other cards in the deck)
* A hint button (if hints are enabled)
* Easy/Hard buttons (if enabled in Config)
* A stake description explaining the current penalty mode

### How Answers Are Recorded to Anki

Every answer is recorded back to Anki's scheduler:

|Situation|Ease sent to Anki|
|-|-|
|Correct, no hint used|3 — Good|
|Correct, hint was used|2 — Hard|
|Wrong answer|1 — Again|
|Easy button clicked|4 — Easy|
|Hard button clicked|2 — Hard|

This means your Anki card intervals update in real time as you play. Cards you struggle with come back sooner; cards you know well are pushed further out.

### Session Tracking

Within a single game, the add-on tracks which cards you have seen and answered. It will not show you the same card twice in a row, works through your active pool before repeating, and prioritizes cards you have answered incorrectly. When you start a new game or switch decks, the session resets.

\---

## Koi-Koi Rules Reference

### The Deck

Hanafuda uses a 48-card deck divided into 12 suits of 4 cards each, one suit per month of the year. Each suit is associated with a flower or plant:

|Month|Plant|Special cards|
|-|-|-|
|January|Pine|Crane (bright)|
|February|Plum|Bush Warbler|
|March|Cherry|Curtain (bright)|
|April|Wisteria|Cuckoo|
|May|Iris|Bridge|
|June|Peony|Butterflies|
|July|Bush Clover|Boar|
|August|Susuki Grass|Moon (bright)|
|September|Chrysanthemum|Sake Cup|
|October|Maple|Deer|
|November|Willow|Rain Man (bright), Swallow|
|December|Paulownia|Phoenix (bright)|

Cards are ranked by type: **Bright** (20 pts) → **Ribbon/Tane** (10 pts) → **Kasu** (plain, 1 pt).

### Setup

Each player is dealt 8 cards. 8 cards are laid face-up on the field. The remaining 24 form the draw pile. The dealer (Oya, marked ★) is determined by a card flip at the start of each game — the player whose flipped card has the lower month number becomes the dealer and goes first.

### A Turn

On your turn you take two actions in sequence:

**1. Play from hand** — select a card from your hand. If it matches the month of a card on the field, you capture both (they go to your captured pile). If there is no match, your card is placed on the field.

**2. Draw from deck** — flip the top card of the draw pile. If it matches a field card, you capture both. If not, it stays on the field.

### Forming Yaku

After each capture (hand play or deck draw), the game checks whether your captured cards form any yaku (scoring combinations — see the Yaku Guide in the game for the full list). If you form a new yaku, you must make a decision:

* **Stop (やめ)** — end the round and collect your points
* **Koi-Koi (こいこい)** — continue playing to try to earn more points, but take a risk: if your opponent forms a yaku before the round ends, your score is doubled in their favour

### End of Round

The round ends when:

* A player calls Stop after forming a yaku
* Both players' hands are empty and the deck is exhausted
* A player's hand is empty and the deck is exhausted (automatic stop)

At the end of the round, the winning player scores points based on their yaku. The losing player's score is reduced by the same amount (in Count Down mode).

### Scoring Multipliers

* **7+ points:** If your total yaku score is 7 or more, it is doubled (×2)
* **Opponent called Koi-Koi:** If your opponent called Koi-Koi earlier in the round and you subsequently form a yaku, your score is doubled (×2)
* **Both conditions:** ×4 total

### Special Deals

If you are dealt any of the following at the start of a round, the round ends immediately:

* **Teshi (手四)** — all four cards of the same month in your opening hand (6 points)
* **Kuttsuki (くっつき)** — four pairs (two cards from four different months) in your opening hand (6 points)

If these appear in the field instead of a hand, the round is void and redealt.

### Oya-Ken (親権) — Dealer's Privilege

If neither player forms any yaku and the round ends with empty hands, the dealer gains 1 point and retains the deal for the next round.
